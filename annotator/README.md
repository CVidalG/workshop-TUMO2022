# Annotation platform

We will use the [VGG Image Annotator (VIA)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/).

VGG Image Annotator is a simple and standalone manual annotation software for image, audio and video. VIA runs in a web browser and does not require any installation or setup. The complete VIA software fits in a single self-contained HTML page of size less than 400 Kilobyte that runs as an offline application in most modern web browsers.
